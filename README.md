# ⭕ Telangana Tourism Data Analysis (2016-2019)
This project focuses on analyzing tourism data in Telangana, India, from the years 2016 to 2019. The data is split into two main categories: domestic visitors (within India) and foreign visitors (from outside India). Using these datasets, I have extracted insights about tourism trends, the impact on various districts, and provide recommendations for improving tourism strategies.

## Project Overview ✔️
The project consists of two major tasks:

### Data Integration:✅

Merging individual CSV files from two categories: domestic and foreign visitors, into two comprehensive datasets (domestic_visitors.csv and foreign_visitors.csv).
The data includes detailed records of visitors to various districts in Telangana for the years 2016 through 2019.

### Business Problem Solving:✅

Using the merged datasets, I have addressed key business problems related to tourism, which are outlined in the document research_questions_and_recommendations.pdf.
These problems focus on identifying visitor patterns, growth trends, and providing recommendations based on the data.

### Datasets:✅
The datasets used in this project are in the repository:

domestic_visitors: Contains CSV files for domestic visitor data (2016-2019).
foreign_visitors: Contains CSV files for foreign visitor data (2016-2019).
After merging the CSV files both the categories, two new files are generated:

domestic_visitors.csv
foreign_visitors.csv

## Data Columns✔️

### domestic_visitors.csv:✅
district: Name of the district in Telangana.
date: The starting date of the month when data was collected.
month: The month for which the data is reported.
year: The year (in YYYY format).
visitors: The number of domestic visitors.

### foreign_visitors.csv:✅
district: Name of the district in Telangana.
date: The starting date of the month when data was collected.
month: The month for which the data is reported.
year: The year (in YYYY format).
visitors: The number of foreign visitors.

## Solved Business Problems:✔️

### I addressed a series of business problems using data analysis techniques, which are present in detail in the research_questions_and_recommendations.pdf file. The questions focus on the following areas:

*Visitor Growth:* Analyze the growth trend of both domestic and foreign visitors across districts.
District-wise Comparison: Compare the popularity of districts among visitors.

*CAGR Analysis:* Calculate the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for different districts.

*Seasonality:* Identify seasonal trends in tourism for both domestic and foreign visitors.
I utilized tools such as Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL, and Power BI to extract these insights.

## Tools Used✅
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib): For data cleaning, merging, and visualization.
SQL: For querying and analyzing data.
Power BI: To create visual representations and dashboards.
Excel: Initial data exploration.
